This the App created by Jerry Monyelo and team for the purpose of the ther DevPost Hackthon


User Interface:

The app has a Streamlit-based web interface with a custom background image related to Valorant.

It's titled "EA SportS Valorant game Assistant" (though it's worth noting that Valorant is actually developed by Riot Games, not EA Sports).

Chat Functionality:

Users can interact with the assistant through a chat interface.

The chat history is maintained throughout the session.

AI Integration:

The app uses Amazon Bedrock to power its AI capabilities.

It connects to a specific Bedrock agent using Agent ID and Agent Alias ID (which are set in the sidebar).

Query Processing:

When a user enters a question, it's sent to the Bedrock agent for processing.

The agent's response is then displayed in the chat interface.

Response Handling:

The AI's responses are parsed and formatted for display.

Responses include the main text content and potentially source references.

Styling and Layout:

The app uses a custom background image, likely featuring Valorant agents.

Chat messages are displayed with a semi-transparent black background for better readability.

Additional Features:

There's an option to view the raw bot response in an expandable section.

Users can clear the chat history if needed.
